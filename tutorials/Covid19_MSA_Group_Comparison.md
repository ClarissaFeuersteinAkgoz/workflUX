# Comparison of Covid-19 Spike Protein Sequences Using Multiple Sequence Alignment

## Introduction to the Workflow

![workflow screenshot](../screenshots/4.00_tutorial_covid19_workflow.png) 

The workflow compares two sets of peptide, DNA, or RNA sequences using following steps:
1. **Multiple sequence alignment** (MSA) and calculate a distance matrix using the Bioconductor’s [msa](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html) package.
2. Generate and plot a **phylogenetic tree** by neighbor-joining using the packages [ape](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/documentation/) and [ggtree](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/documentation/).

There are two required input parameters (fasta_1 and fasta_2) that represent **two sets of sequences** in fasta format. Optional parameters include the sequence type, msa method, and distance type. The workflow’s main output is a plot of a **phylogenetic tree** showing the relation of the two sets.

The workflow can be found at: https://github.com/CompEpigen/msa_group_compare

## Aim of the Demo:

Using the above workflow, we would like to investigate whether there has been a change in the sequence of **COVID19 surface glycoprotein** between the early outbreak in China and the subsequent **wave in Europe**.

Therefore we will compare sequences from two patient cohorts:

* **China**, until the end of **2019, 11 patients**
* **Europe**, in January **2020, 10 patients**

## **Step 1: Register with Your ELIXIR Account**

1. Connect to CWLab using your browser of choice: https://cwlab.krini.ingress.rancher.computational.bio/

You should see a welcome screen like this:

ELIXIR AAI will ask you to register your account to be part of a specific group.

3. Please fill in the registration form and submit.


Upon successful registration, you should see a message like this:

2. Please provide CWLab access to the requested information.

## **Step 4: Provide Input Parameters**

An HTML form will appear that asks you to provide input parameters for this run. There are only **two required parameters (fasta_1 and fasta_2)**. The **remaining parameters are optional** and pre-set with their defaults, but feel free to play around.

1. Provide the S-protein sequences for the two patient cohorts by copy & pasting following HTTP URLs:

![fasta screenshot](../screenshots/4.05_tutorial_covid19_fasta.PNG) 

![parameter screenshot](../screenshots/4.06_tutorial_covid19_provide_parameter.png) 

> **Please Note**: Your parameters are **automatically validated** to avoid bad surprises when starting the run.

> Please Note: The entire parameter form has been created from the information parsed from the CWL workflow itself. No additional configuration was needed upon import.
If you don‘t know the meaning of a parameter, please cilck on the :information_source: button to get documentation.

![validate screenshot](../screenshots/4.07_tutorial_covid19_validate.png) 

2. Click on **validate and create job**.

Please wait

![execute screenshot](../screenshots/4.08_tutorial_covid19_execute.png) 

3. Once a green success message occurs, you may click on **Job Execution & Results** in the top bar. 

## **Step 5: Submit to WES**

Now it is time to submit your job to a WES endpoint for execution.

![select job screenshot](../screenshots/4.09_tutorial_covid19_select_job.png) 

1. Select the newly created job in the left panel.

![select run screenshot](../screenshots/4.10_tutorial_covid19_select_run.png) 

2. Select the run.

3. Select a WES endpoint.

4. Press start.

![select running screenshot](../screenshots/4.11_tutorial_covid19_running.png) 

After a few seconds, the run status should turn to ***RUNNING***. If many executions are happening in parallel you might also see QUEUED.

Please wait

![select complete screenshot](../screenshots/4.12_tutorial_covid19_complete.png) 

Once the status turned to ***RUNNING***, your execution should complete within 2-5 min.

## **Step 6: Explore the Output**

Once the execution has finished, you are probably interested in retrieving and exploring the output.

1. Click on Details for the completed run.

![select details screenshot](../screenshots/4.13_tutorial_covid19_details.png) 

2. Click on Output Files.

![select output screenshot](../screenshots/4.14_tutorial_covid19_outputfiles.png) 

3. Please select the **phylogenetic_tree.png**.

4. Press **download selected file**.

![select output screenshot](../screenshots/4.15_tutorial_covid19_download.png) 

Please open the png with an image viewer of your choice.

**Congratulation, you have reached the end of this demo!**

You have successfully carried out an analysis based on public data using GA4GH-compliant infrastructure. All of this without a line of code. 

With the obtained results, you may know try to answer the original question of this task: **Is there evidence for a difference in the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein sequence between the early outbreak in China and the subsequent wave in Europe?**
