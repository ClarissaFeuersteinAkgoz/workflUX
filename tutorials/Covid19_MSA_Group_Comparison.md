# Comparison of Covid-19 Spike Protein Sequences Using Multiple Sequence Alignment

## Introduction to the Workflow

The workflow compares two sets of peptide, DNA, or RNA sequences using following steps:
1. **Multiple sequence alignment** (MSA) and calculate a distance matrix using the Bioconductorâ€™s [msa](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msa.html) package.
2. Generate and plot a **phylogenetic tree** by neighbor-joining using the packages [ape](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/documentation/) and [ggtree](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/documentation/).
